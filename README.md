# ApproximateBayesianComputationMCMC

All of the code is in the abc_mcmc.ipynb notebook. Earlier versions of the code (now deprecated) can be found in the algorithms and goals folder.

You will need to install numpy, scipy, and matplotlib in order to the run the notebook.

To reproduce results and graphs and LaTeX code for tables, run all the cells in order. Note that RNG seeding is used so results are exactly reproducible.
